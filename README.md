# HYDICE
The data set was acquired by imaging an area of Michigan, USA, with the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) sensor. With a resolution of approximately 2 m, the original image contains 210 bands from the visible to the near-infrared spectrum. After removing the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and water absorption bands, 175 bands are reserved for experiments. An image containing 80Ã—100 pixels is cropped for experiments. 
# Objects to be Detected in HYDICE
Vehicles distributed in 10 different locations occupy 21 pixels are treated as objects to be detected.
